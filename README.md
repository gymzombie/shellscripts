# shellscripts

Just a collection of random files and tools I've built or used over the years. 
This is likely begged borrowed and stolen from various other scripts/sources and just massaged to my purposes. 

Also likely full of errors and might be outdated. Feel free to call out, fix, or point me to better solutions.
